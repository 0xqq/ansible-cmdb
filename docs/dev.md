## Contributions

If you wish to contribute code, please consider the following:

* Code should be reasonably PEP8-like. I'm not too strict on this.
* One logical change per merge request.
* By putting in a merge request or putting code in comments, you automatically
  grant me permission to include this code in ansible-cmdb under the license
  (GPLv3) that ansible-cmdb uses. The copyright for contributed code is
  retained by the contributor.
* Please don't be disappointed or angry if your contributions end up unused.
  It's not that they aren't appreciated, but I can be somewhat strict when it
  comes to code quality, feature creep, etc.

When in doubt, just open a pull request and post a comment on what you're
unclear of, and we'll figure it out.

# History

Ansible-cmdb started as a short Python script, which I [blogged
about](http://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2015/01/21/host-inventory-overview-using-ansibles-facts/).

[Cris van Pelt](https://melkfl.es/) then took that and expanded it into a HTML
page. Eventually I forked it to Github and made it public, adding features.
[Many people collaborated](https://github.com/fboender/ansible-cmdb/graphs/contributors) to
make Ansible-cmdb into what it is today.
